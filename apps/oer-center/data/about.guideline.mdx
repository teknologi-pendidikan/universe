# About us

Welcome to our Open Educational Resources (OER) repository! Our platform is dedicated to providing freely accessible learning materials for students and lecturers in the field of Educational Technology in Indonesia. We recognized the diverse landscape of educational technology knowledge spread across various universities in the country, but identified a lack of openly available learning resources among these institutions.

## Goals and Objectives

Through our open learning resource repository, we aim to address the need for equalizing knowledge and providing free and accessible learning resources in the field of Educational Technology. By utilizing OER, we contribute to the continuous growth and democratization of educational technology knowledge in Indonesia.

Our mission is to bridge this gap by developing an open learning resource repository specifically tailored to the needs of students and lecturers in Educational Technology. Our primary objective is to enable knowledge sharing through the exchange of learning resources between institutions. By harnessing the power of OER, learners can freely contribute their materials and license them for others to access and utilize.

## Target Audience

What sets our repository apart is its unique ability to continuously expand its content collections within the OER framework. This feature ensures that our platform remains a vibrant and attractive resource for both students and lecturers. As the field of educational technology evolves, so too will our repository, growing alongside the changing needs and advancements in educational technology knowledge.

## Development Process

Our development process involves collecting student assignments and modules from various universities, which are then meticulously analyzed for content quality by our team of product development curators. We actively gather and scrape content from Learning Management Systems (LMS) to ensure a comprehensive collection of learning resources. So far, we have obtained 30 learning resources from two universities, covering five topic areas. This indicates the strong interest of students and educational technology lecturers in sharing their valuable learning content. Their dedication to equalizing knowledge and providing free and open learning resources among themselves is commendable.

The process for the OER repository involves a comprehensive approach to ensure the highest quality and relevance of the learning resources we provide. We understand the importance of curating materials that meet the specific needs of students and lecturers in the field of Educational Technology. Here's an overview of the steps we follow:

1. Collaborative Partnership: We establish collaborative partnerships with universities and educational institutions involved in Educational Technology. These partnerships allow us to work closely with faculty members, students, and administrators to gather valuable learning materials.

2. Content Collection: We actively collect student assignments, modules, and other relevant learning resources from participating universities. By collaborating with educational technology departments, we gain access to a wide range of up-to-date content.

3. Content Analysis: Our team of expert curators carefully analyzes the collected content to ensure its quality, accuracy, and alignment with educational standards. We assess factors such as educational objectives, pedagogical approaches, and relevance to the field of Educational Technology.

4. Quality Assurance: We have a rigorous quality assurance process in place to verify the accuracy and credibility of the learning resources. Our team conducts thorough checks for factual accuracy, proper citations, and adherence to copyright regulations.

5. Collaboration with Faculty: We actively engage with faculty members and subject matter experts to seek their input and expertise. Their insights help us refine and enhance the content, ensuring that it reflects the latest advancements and best practices in the field of Educational Technology.

6. Feedback Loop: We encourage feedback from both students and lecturers who utilize the OER repository. Their input is invaluable in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of the learning resources. We continuously iterate and update the repository based on this feedback.

7. Expansion of Content: As our repository grows, we expand our content collections across various topics and sub-disciplines within Educational Technology. This expansion is driven by the evolving needs and interests of our users, ensuring a comprehensive and diverse range of resources.

8. Technological Infrastructure: We employ advanced technologies and systems to support the storage, retrieval, and organization of the learning resources. Our platform is designed to provide a user-friendly experience, allowing easy navigation, search, and filtering options.

9. Collaboration with Open Source Community: We actively collaborate with the open-source community to leverage their expertise and contributions. This collaboration helps us enhance the functionalities of our repository and promotes the broader adoption of OER principles and practices.

10. Continuous Improvement: We are committed to continuous improvement and staying at the forefront of developments in educational technology. We regularly assess emerging trends, pedagogical approaches, and technological advancements to ensure that our repository remains a cutting-edge resource for students and lecturers.

By following this meticulous development process, we ensure that our OER repository meets the highest standards of quality, relevance, and accessibility. We are dedicated to providing a valuable platform for students and lecturers in the field of Educational Technology, enabling them to access, contribute, and share knowledge freely.
